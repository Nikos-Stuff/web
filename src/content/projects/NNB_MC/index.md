# A Minecraft replica / fanmade project based on roblox nico's nextbots

## Looking for devs!
Since this project is getting a bit of attention, I'm open for any kind of partnership / collab etc
If you know how to properly use vanilla commands and have a bit of plugins knowledge (very simple stuff) Join our discord and DM me!



# About
A game heavily inspired by gmod where you get chased by loud png's - now in Minecraft!
Run, gain points, unlock cosmetics, level up your character!
So basically, i recreated nnb in Minecraft!




# Notice
This is my free time project / project 4fun. But i do care about bugs and issues.
If you found something, please let me know in the comments or here in our discord!
Thanks <3

## Oh also 4/5 players recommend for the most fun!
Otherwise, the bots will be only following you and your friend, and it will be kinda boring.

# Modes:
For now there's only Arcade Mode but I'm also working on Open World & Social Space!
In Arcade Mode your goal is to beat other players by jumping, possessing other bots and killing players,
doing sick parkour etc.!
Just go crazy and have fun!
