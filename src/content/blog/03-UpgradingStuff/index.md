Hi! Welcome again. So as we move on with updates and other stuff, most of the pages / projects that I made will be
replaced with more optimized and faster stuff!

# What was used in most cases?
Well until now I was using WordPress with custom plugins and themes - that was really slow and unstable.
Now I kinda moved to astro and I think static websites is all what I need for stuff like that.

# Will custom features be ported?
Since I don't want to ruin the whole aspect of providing static content - yes, and no.
Most of the stuff will be server as a separate subdomains to just not mess around the code too much.

# When it will happen?
Porting stuff will happen only for compatible projects like "Sklep Sezam" + payment must be made.
That task is kinda long and painful to do, because it contains a bunch of steps:

- Replicating old site content
- Adjusting the content to the new design language
- Explaining how the page operates and how to add new stuff (like posts) to it
- Optimizing and updating content regularly 

And that's all for now. Thanks for reading and have a great day!
