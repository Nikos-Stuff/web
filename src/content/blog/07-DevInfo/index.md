Just a quick note about our projects and stuff.
We're hardly working on everything and won't leave anything behind. So please note that updates are on the way for every project / product.
They may be just slower etc.


# What was W.I.P.?
Actually a lot of stuff! A few of our projects will now receive big updates!
- Niko's Stuff
- Niko's Nextbots
- Overall page

And probably more


# Again sorry...
Yeah, sorry for lack activity here, but we will be back soon!

See ya!
