Greetings! It has been a while since we posted that type of post. 
So, since im as for now chilling and having a small break from anything, there's nothing much happening

# New Pricing
You know that one.
Since my services are well uh somewhat professional, I needed to come up with good and manageable prices.
Leave a message in our Discord and tell us what do you think about it.

# Quick WebInfo Panel
Custom-made pages has evolved a little bit. Now you can see basic information and health of your site.
Note that they're available for everyone to see, but don't worry - nothing important is displayed in that
simple panel.

### Main Page
In the main page you will see most important info, like Active Plans, Health Lookup and info about hosting
provider.

### Updater Page
This page contains changelog and status of your site compatibility with the new patch.
Every update related to main components will be executed in extremely safe way.
(Stuff that will need to change in order to smoothly update will be modified.)

### Security Page
This is the last (for now) page for our small panel.
It will contain security state of your product.
Security related patches / Optimization will be applied when possible
(If there's a compatibility issue, site won't be patched until the major update will be applied etc.)


### Extra notes:
- If you choose yearly payment instead of one time, button for payment will appear in the quick panel. (PayPal)
- This extra panel can be hidden or removed if you don't like it - Not recommended



# That's kinda it for now!
Obviously, a bunch of bugfixes and other minor stuff has been fixed. The biggest one is now that we
run now on the latest version of astro + with enabled experimental Server-Side components that will allow
us to make a bit of dynamic stuff like comments, etc.

See ya soon!
