Ayo!
Weâ€™re excited to announce that our new pricing section is now live!
You can explore our updated web development plans and choose the one that fits your needs.

# Web Development
Weâ€™ve introduced a variety of plans for our web development services.
Each plan includes basic web hosting, but you have the option to upgrade to a more professional solution if needed
(like a higher plan at OVH).

Hereâ€™s a quick look at what we offer:

- **Simple Website:** Ideal for basic sites such as blogs or link aggregators. This plan provides a solid foundation with essential features.
- **Standard Website:** Perfect for business sites or portfolios that need more customization and advanced functionality.
- **Premium Website:** Designed for high-traffic sites or complex projects, offering top-tier performance and high-end design.

All our plans are managed by us to ensure high performance and security standards. Plus, youâ€™ll have full control over your website via GitHub â€” feel free to tweak, remake, or modify it as you like. We donâ€™t mind!

Thatâ€™s all for now. Have a great day and stay tuned for more updates. See you in the next one!
