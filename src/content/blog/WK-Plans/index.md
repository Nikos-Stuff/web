Hey ha! I don't know if this even going to work since this was some sort of staged commit in some sort? Never mind!

## What's Been Happening?

So since we refined our website a bit, lets maybe use it more! Uh- well... FOR EXAMPLE: 

- **New Tag/Category**: Introducing the **Weekly Chill** category to keep you updated regularly on our plans, projects, and musings.
- **Upcoming Content**: Sneak peeks into upcoming blog posts, projects in development, and insights into our creative process.


## Sounds kinda cool

Yeah! So every week or so there will be a new post with all of my & our stuff that are still cooking. This will be also properly
available in our Discord server. 

Since this is the first one, that will be it for now. But watch out for next one ðŸ‘€ Maybe there will be something cool?
