Hello everyone!

It's been a while since our last update, and I’m currently enjoying a brief break. There’s not much going on right now, but here are some key updates:

# New Pricing Structure
As our services are becoming more refined, we’ve introduced a new pricing model to better reflect their professional quality. Feel free to drop a message in our Discord to share your thoughts on the new pricing.

# Quick WebInfo Panel
Our custom-made pages have received a few updates. You can now view basic site information and health status. While this panel is publicly accessible, rest assured that no sensitive details are displayed.

### Main Page
The main page offers crucial information such as Active Plans, Health Lookup, and details about your hosting provider.

### Updater Page
This page provides the changelog and status of your site’s compatibility with the latest patch. Updates to main components will be handled with utmost care, ensuring smooth transitions and minimal disruptions.

### Security Page
The Security Page, our latest addition, displays the current security state of your product. Security patches and optimizations will be applied as needed, with compatibility issues addressed before major updates are implemented.

### Additional Notes:
- For those opting for annual payments instead of a one-time fee, a payment button (via PayPal) will appear in the quick panel.
- The entire WebInfo Panel can be disabled if you prefer, although this is not recommended as it provides useful insights into your site’s status.

# That's all for now!
We've also resolved numerous bugs and made other minor improvements. Notably, we are now operating on the latest version of Astro with experimental Server-Side components, enabling us to introduce dynamic features like comments.

Catch you soon!
