Hi! I've been working on some stuff lately - that's why nothing is happening here 👀


# Projects that are being updated / rewritten.

### Niko's Nextbots (1.20.5 -> 1.21.1) 3.x.x
Currently being rewritten in JMC for better code organization and speed / simplicity with new and improved features etc.

### Niko's Stuff
Whole core game mechanics are being improved and organized for better workflow etc.

### VibeCraft (1.20.6 -> 1.21.1)
Bugfixes, New Features and more stuff.
Old version was really broken and bugged.


So yeah. That's why there's silence (I'm the only dev here)

Have a great day! And see ya soon!
