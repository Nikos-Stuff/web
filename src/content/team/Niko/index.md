Random guy that uh - likes to mess around with code and break stuff.
That's how learning works mates!

## 👀 Why and wat?
I started creating my first website in early 2018. I never touched any coding lessons because they're just boring and repetitive.
So while yes my first steps was in scratch, now i kinda evolved a little bit

## 🖌️ Knowledge

- JavaScript (Still learning - C u r s ed)
- TypeScript (We don't talk about this one)
- Astro
- HTML
- LUA(u)
