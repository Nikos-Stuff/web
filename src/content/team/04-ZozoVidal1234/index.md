Bonjo- uhm, hello !
I’m a goofy ahh 14 years old guy who loves to cook weird, unusual, stupid, goofy, silly and virtual things… and sometimes hates its own country !

## ⁉️ HOW ???
Welp, since I’m very young, I always loved just…CREATING VIRTUAL THINGS, specifically on Minecraft.
I’m also a prehistoric fauna lover and a horror enthusiast.
But at the end of 2023, I started to lost interest for creating maps and Add-Ons on Minecraft Bedrock, because well…Who would I show them to ?
And since I have Discord, I finally have people to show them to !

## 🔥 WHAT I CAN DO 1!!1!1!11!

- Minecraft maps (depend on the size and the details)
- Blockbench models + texture (except for large model textures)
- Roblox maps (also depend on the size and details lol)
- Designer
- Concept arts (Only IRL)
